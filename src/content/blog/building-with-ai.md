Last month I shipped three side projects. A year ago, that would have taken me three months. The difference? AI coding assistants.

I'm not a developer by trade—I'm a product manager. I know enough JavaScript to be dangerous, but building a full app from scratch always felt like climbing a mountain. Now it feels more like taking an elevator.

## The Workflow

My process is simple. I start with a clear problem I want to solve. For mm food, it was "I'm tired of squinting at restaurant menus trying to figure out what's gluten-free." For GTFS.fyi, it was "transit data is hard to visualize without expensive tools."

Then I describe what I want to an AI assistant. Not vague wishes, but specific features. "Show me a map with all bus routes colored by frequency." The AI writes the code, I test it, we iterate.

## What Actually Changed

The biggest shift isn't speed—it's confidence. Before, I'd abandon projects when I hit a wall I couldn't climb. Now I just describe the wall and get a ladder.

I still make architectural decisions. I still design the user experience. I still decide what's worth building. The AI handles the syntax I'd otherwise spend hours Googling.

## The Catch

You need taste. AI will happily build exactly what you ask for, even if it's the wrong thing. Knowing what to build is still the hard part. Fortunately, that's what I do for a living.
