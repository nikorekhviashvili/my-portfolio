This is a sample blog post to test the new writing setup. You can delete this once you've written your first real post.

## Writing in Obsidian

You can write posts in Obsidian by:

1. Opening the `src/content/blog/` folder as a vault (or linking it)
2. Creating a new markdown file with frontmatter
3. Saving and pushing to git

## Frontmatter

Each post needs this at the top:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "A short description for previews"
date: "2026-01-01"
---
```

## Markdown Features

All standard markdown works:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- `inline code`
- Lists (like this one)

> Blockquotes work too.

That's it! Simple and fast.
